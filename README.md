## üëÄ A First Overview

Welcome to this year's **Ô£øWWDC21** Swift Student Challenge! I'm very proud to present you my submission called `Coding with Robo`. I wanted to take part in this challenge to deepen my newly gained coding skills and learn more about the amazing world of app development with Swift and SwiftUl.

**To keep it short:** My submission is a Swift Playground that playfully introduces you to the basics of Swift and SwiftUI by programming a mini-quiz in less than three minutes.

**Longer:** As a student, I am steadily looking for new challenges and am always open for something new. This was also the case about half a year ago, when I got into app development through an internship. At that time, still completely inexperienced, I taught myself Swift and SwiftUI by watching videos, reading books and learning from experienced developers. In such a short period of time, app development has grabbed me so much that I now want to motivate more people to start programming. With just a few lines of code and a small amount of time you can already achieve great things! And the first step in the right direction is called `Coding with Robo`.

This playground is designed to be used by a wide variety of people, so the following accessibility features were considered:
* **Responsive design** for optimal support of both small and large devices
* **Text to Speech** in the respective national language
* Swift Playground running on **iPadOS** and **macOS**
