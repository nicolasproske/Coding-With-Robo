# Coding with Robo
### Swift Student Challenge

---

## About My Submission
### 1. General
**To keep it short:** _Coding with Robo_ is a Swift Playground that playfully introduces you to the basics of Swift and SwiftUI by programming a mini-quiz in less than three minutes.

**Longer:** As a student, I am steadily looking for new challenges and am always open for something new. This was also the case about half a year ago, when I got into app development through an internship. At that time, still completely inexperienced, I taught myself Swift and SwiftUI by watching videos, reading books and learning from experienced developers. In such a short period of time, app development has grabbed me so much that I now want to motivate more people to start programming. With just a few lines of code and a small amount of time you can already achieve great things! And the first step in the right direction is called `Coding with Robo` 😉.

### 2. Usability & Accessibility Support
