//: ## Step 1: Adding functions with parameters
//: - Note: ü§ñ says: *"For your first game I would suggest staying simple. Therefore, a quiz is a nice choice! A quiz needs..? - Questions, correct! I already added some default questions, but you can of course add more if you want!"*
//: 1. Adding questions is easy: Type `addQuestion("Bee", "üêù")` and replace both the text and emoji with the correct answer and the associated emoji.
//:
//#-editable-code
// Add your questions line by line below
addQuestion("Dinosaur", "ü¶ñ")

//#-end-editable-code

//: ## Step 2: Calling sub-functions
//: - Note: ü§ñ says: *"Nice choice, this is going to be an amazing quiz! To mix up the questions, call the `shuffle()` method on our questions."*
//: 1. Add `.shuffle()` at the end of `questions`.
//:
//#-editable-code
// Call the .shuffle() method
questions
